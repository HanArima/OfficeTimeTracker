# Office Time Tracker

It is a Chrome Extension that can be easily added to your working chrome browser.

## Back Story
While filling my timesheet, I was once counting the hours and minutes I have worked yet on my fingers. Although, when I had to calculate exact minutes I took out the calculator. BUt teh calculator does not know that I am claculating time and an hour only has 60 mins so it should factor in that point...
As a computer science student, I switched to coding and making my own logic that will calculate the time for me
